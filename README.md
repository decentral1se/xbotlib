## XMPP bots for humans

> status: experimental

A friendly lightweight wrapper around
[slixmpp](https://slixmpp.readthedocs.io/) for writing XMPP bots in Python. The
goal is to make writing and running XMPP bots easy and fun. `xbotlib` is a
[single file implementation](./xbotlib.py) which can easily be understood and
extended. It provides a small API surface which reflects the `slixmpp` way of
doing things.

The `xbotlib` source code and ideas are largely
borrowed/stolen/adapted/reimagined from the XMPP bot experiments that have gone
on and are still going on in
[Varia](https://git.vvvvvvaria.org/explore/repos?tab=&sort=recentupdate&q=bots).

## Install

```sh
$ pip install xbotlib
```

## Example

Put the following in a `echo.py` file.

`xbotlib` provides a number of example bots which you can use to get moving
fast and try things out.

```python
from xbotlib import EchoBot

EchotBot()
```

And then `python echo.py`. You will be asked a few questions in order to load
the account details that your bot will be using. This will generate a
`echobot.conf` file in the same working directory for further use. See the
[configuration](#configure-your-bot) section for more.

Here's the code for the `EchoBot`.

```python
class EchoBot(Bot):
    def direct(self, message):
        self.reply(message.body, to=message.sender)

    def group(self, message):
        if "echobot" in message.body:
            self.reply(message.body.split(":")[-1], room=message.room)
```

Read more in the [API reference](#api-reference) for how to write your own bots.

## All examples

- **EchoBot**: Sends back what you sent it
- **WhisperBot**: Anonymous whispering in group chats

See [xbotlib.py](./xbotlib.py) for all example bots.

## API Reference

When writing your own bot, you always sub-class the `Bot` class provided from
`xbotlib`. Then if you want to respond to a direct message, you write a
[direct](#botdirectmessage) function. If you want to respond to a group chat
message, you write a [group](#botgroupmessage) function.

### Bot.direct(message)

Respond to direct messages.

Arguments:

- **message**: received message (see [SimpleMessage](#simplemessage) below for available attributes)

### Bot.group(message)

Respond to a message in a group chat.

Arguments:

- **message**: received message (see [SimpleMessage](#simplemessage) below for available attributes)

### SimpleMessage

A simple message interface.

Attributes:

- **body**: the body of the message
- **sender**: the user the message came from
- **room**: the room the message came from
- **receiver**: the receiver of the message
- **nickname**: the nickname of the sender
- **type**: the type of message (`chat` or `groupchat`)

## Documenting your bot

Add a `help = "my help"` to your `Bot` class like so.

```python
class MyBot(Bot):
    help = "My help"
```

See more in the [commands](#commands) section on how to use this.

## Commands

Using `!<command>` in direct messages and `<nick>:!<command>` in group chats,
here are the supported commands.

- **!uptime**: how long the bot has been running
- **!help**: the end-user provided help text of what the bot does

There are also more general status commands which all bots respond to.

- **/bots**: status check on who is a bot in the group chat

## Avatars

By default, `xbotlib` will look for an `avatar.png` (so far tested with `.png`
but other file types may work) file alongside your Python script which contains
your bot implementation. You can also specify another path using the `--avatar`
option on the command-line interface. The images should ideally have a height
of `64` and a width of `64` pixels each.

## Configure your bot

All the ways you can pass configuration details to your bot.

### Using the `.conf` configuration file

If you run simply run your Python script which contains the bot then `xbotlib`
will generate a configuration for you by asking a few questions. This is the
simplest way to run your bot locally.

### Using the command-line interface

Every bot accepts a number of comand-line arguments to load configuration. You
can use the `--help` option to see what is available (e.g. `python bot.py --help`).

### Using the environment

`xbotlib` will try to read the following configuration values from the
environment if it cannot read them from a configuration file or the
command-line interface. This can be useful when doing remote server
deployments.

- **XBOT_ACCOUNT**: The bot account
- **XBOT_PASSWORD**: The bot password
- **XBOT_NICK**: The bot nickname

## Deploy your bots

See [bots.varia.zone](https://bots.varia.zone/).

## Persistent storage

## Redis key/value

`xbotlib` supports using [Redis](https://redis.io/) as a storage back-end. It
is simple to work with because the interface is exactly like a dictionary. Here
is how to quickly run Redis locally (using
[Docker](https://docs.docker.com/engine/install/debian/)).

```bash
$ docker run --network=host --name redis -d redis
$ export REDIS_URL=redis://localhost:6379/0
```

And you access the interface via the `self.db` attribute.

```python
def direct(self, message):
    self.db["my-message"] = message.body
```

You should see `INFO Successfully connected to storage` when your bot
initialises. Please see the `GlossBot` example for more on how to work with
this type of storage.
